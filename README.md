# Mongo-Scrape
Scraping data from websites and storing it in Mongodb

Users are also able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. Comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users are also able to delete comments left on articles. Stored comments are visible to every user.
